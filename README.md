I recently created a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI, and I’m thrilled to showcase my work! 

Through this journey, I explored data visualization, interactive reporting, and business intelligence, turning raw data into meaningful insights. A big thanks to the  Ravi ramawat sir and Satish dhawale for helping me build these skills!

- Key Features of My Dashboard:
* Comprehensive Sales Analysis – Total sales, quantity, and transaction trends.
* MTD & Yearly Comparisons – Month-to-date and year-over-year performance tracking.
* Interactive Visuals – Drill-through analysis, filters, and detailed insights.
* Business Intelligence at Work – Helping make data-driven decisions.

This project has strengthened my understanding of Power BI and data analytics, and I’m excited to keep learning and building more dashboards!
